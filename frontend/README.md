# Recipe Finder â€“ Frontend

This is the frontend application for Recipe Finder, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**.

## Main Features

- Search for recipes by ingredients using the Spoonacular API
- Horizontal carousel for browsing recipes
- Highlights missing ingredients in each recipe
- Cuisine filters and responsive layout
- Sidebar navigation and decorative patterns

## Project Structure

- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Carousel, etc.)
- `src/layout/`: Layout and global contexts (e.g., `CuisineContext`)
- `src/pages/`: Main app pages (Home, Recipes, Ingredients, etc.)

## Conventions & Best Practices

- **Strict typing**: No use of `any`; all components and refs are strongly typed.
- **Generic Carousel**: Use the `createCarousel` factory to create a typed carousel:
  ```tsx
  import createCarousel from '../components/Carousel'
  const Carousel = createCarousel<MyType>()
  ```
- **Separated contexts**: React contexts are in dedicated files (e.g., `CuisineContext.tsx`).
- **Input**: The `Input` component supports the `ref` prop and all standard HTML input attributes.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
